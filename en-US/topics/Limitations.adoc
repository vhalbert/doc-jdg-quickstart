= Limitations

The following are the current limitations to using a JDG cache:

*  Multiple root pojo's in the same JDG Cache are not recommended unless access patterns are added so that "Select ALL" is disabled.   This is because "Select ALL" will cause a ClassCastException because its expecting to only deal with one pojo class type.

*  Unfortunately for using protobufs, complex data types (i.e., Big Decimal) don't convert to C / C++. So it is recommended to stick with primitive data types. There are 3 options:

1. use all primitive data types
2. implement a marshaller that will handle the conversion
3. create a view that will convert the bigdecimal to a string, then materialize that view.

This will especially come into play when a view is to be materialized.  Thought will have to given to the data types in the view.


*  Materialization does not support loading complex objects.  Example, either a 1-to-1 or 1-to-many relationship.
